/**
 * Alcove search profile.
 *
 * This is the one file to edit to point Alcove at *your* apartment hunt:
 * where you're searching, the place you want a short commute to, the
 * neighborhoods and budgets you care about, and the sources to check.
 *
 * It is imported by:
 *   - the Convex importer action  (convex/apartmentImportActions.ts)
 *   - the offline import CLI       (scripts/import-apartment-runs.mjs)
 *   - the automation prompt generator (scripts/generate-automation-prompt.mjs)
 *
 * Keep it plain ESM (no TS, no Node-only APIs, just data + pure functions).
 *
 * The defaults below describe a Manhattan rental search. Replace them with
 * your own city, target, neighborhoods, budgets, and sources.
 *

 * @property {string} [streetAddress]

 *
 * @typedef {Object} BudgetBand
 * @property {string} label                 Human label, e.g. "1BR".
 * @property {[number, number]} [preferred] Preferred [min, max] monthly rent.

 * @property {number} [max]                 Upper bound when there is no range.
 * @property {number} [stretch]             Allowed only if unusually strong.
 * @property {string} [note]               Extra shortlist requirement.
 * @property {string} [extra]              Additional automation-only guidance.

You are the ${config.appName} apartment import agent. Research exactly one apartment link and return field-by-field structured data for the ${config.appName} database.

Use the provided URL as the source of truth, then use web search/fetch to fill gaps from direct building, broker, operator, or portal pages. Be strict about live verification. Do not invent unavailable fields. Return null only for nullable fields that are genuinely not verified. Use "unknown" for laundry and dishwasher only after checking listing text, amenity lists, unit/building details, photos, floor plan evidence, and direct operator/broker pages.

Ranking standards:
${rankingStandards}

Structured output rules:
- The schema is intentionally compact so it can be grammar-constrained reliably. Put each fact into its field; do not invent extra JSON keys.
- name must be specific and useful: preferably "Building #Unit" or "Street Address #Unit". Do not use generic names like "Apartment listing", "StreetEasy listing", "Rental unit", "Available apartment", or a neighborhood-only title when a building, address, or unit exists.
- buildingName is the named building when present, otherwise null. unit is the exact unit/apartment identifier when present, otherwise null.
- streetAddress is the formatted street/unit address line as verified from the source. If the source separates unit, include the street in streetAddress and unit in unit; name should still include the unit.
- addressLink should be a source, maps, or detail URL that verifies the address. If there is no separate address URL, set addressLink to the verified listing URL.
- price must be numeric monthly rent in USD when verified. Put formatted price text in priceDisplay.
- bedrooms and bathrooms must be numbers, including 0 for a verified studio and decimals like 1.5 when present.
- laundry and dishwasher must be exactly "yes", "no", or "unknown".
- amenities is for user-facing amenity labels only. Do not put prose there.
- notes must be short, under about 360 characters, and should explain fit/caveats such as daylight, renovation, floor plan, or furniture fit. Never dump page text or restate all structured fields in notes.
- sourcesSearched should list real URLs/domains searched or fetched.

Required field guardrail for manual add:
- Do not return a listing just because the URL card looks promising. Open/fetch the detail page first and extract the core fields from the page itself.
- Required rich fields are name, url, addressLink, streetAddress, price, bedrooms, bathrooms, laundry, and dishwasher. If one is missing from the source page, keep looking on the detail page, embedded structured data, unit row, official building availability page, broker page, or property-manager page before giving up.
- If price, bedrooms, bathrooms, streetAddress, or a verifying addressLink still cannot be verified after deeper searching, say exactly what is missing in warnings and return null/unknown in the structured field; the importer will reject it instead of adding an incomplete active row.

Allowed status values: shortlist, monitor, excluded, archived.
Allowed track values: 1br, 2br, 3br, unknown.
Allowed freshness values: verified_live, availability_page_only, stale_or_mismatch, unverified.
Allowed confidence values: high, medium, low, blocked, unknown.
